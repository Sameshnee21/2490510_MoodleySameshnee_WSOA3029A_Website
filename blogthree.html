      <h2>INTRODUCTION: INTERACTION FOR DATA VISUALIZATION
        WHAT IS DATA VISUALIZATION?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Data visualization is the representation of data, that being large amounts of 
information, through visual implementations such as illustrations, graphs or maps
(Li, 2020). Data visualization began using traditional forms to display data such as 
tables, graphs and charts however, as computers and other technological advances 
surfaced, people found that it was “easier and more affordable” (Li, 2020) to digitize 
large amounts of data. The main purpose of data visualization is to communicate and 
create a better understanding of data for users. 
While data visualization helps users, interactivity in data visualization takes user 
communication and understanding one step further by creating a relationship
“between human and computer” (Dimara & Perin, 2019). Interactivity widens the 
freedom of visualization and constructs an inclusive space for “perspectives of 
information visualization” (Dimara & Perin, 2019).

      <h2>WHAT IS INTERACTION FOR DATA VISUALIZATION?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        
        The interaction for data visualization must include 2 crucial elements, that being 
        “external and internal entities” (Dimara & Perin, 2019). External entities involve the 
        “user and the data” or in other words, a person initiating an interaction with the 
        visualization system. The visual system includes elements such as “non-static 
        imagery”, “computational tools” such as a keyboard and mouse (Dimara & Perin, 
        2019). This system functions in real-time which provides in an immediate response in 
        response to an action such as clicking a button. Internal entities can be defined as a 
        goal or intention derived from exploration that can modify the representation or 
        information as a form of “knowledge creation” (Dimara & Perin, 2019). Internal entities 
        displays data for the user to interact and collaborate with to broaden the perspectives 
        of the information. This is encouraged as it helps verify data and information for future 
        users.
        
      </p>
<p class="paragraph">
    External and internal actions within each of the entities involve the relationship 
between user and system depending on the interaction and choices made. External 
actions can be defined as the “action-reaction pairs” also known as the “dialogue”
between user and system (Dimara & Perin, 2019). Internal actions depend on physical 
objects in order to generate an outcome for the user to decode through the users 
cognitive activity. The user depends on their cognitive process interact with and create 
an “internal representation” to understand the visual system (Dimara & Perin, 2019). 
</p>

      

      <h2>WHY IS INTERACTION IMPORTANT IN DATA SYSTEMS?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        Large amounts of data become overwhelming to read and understand, which, as a 
result becomes tedious for the user. Interaction plays a key role in designing a better 
system nevertheless it has its disadvantages as well, such as becoming a type of 
design that focuses on research rather than designing for interactivity. This means that 
the design in place does not consider the user experience. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> 
            The advantages, on the other hand, if designs are taken into proper consideration can 
            process data that is user friendly and “amplifies cognition” in users which contributes 
            to collaborative insights and improved information space. According to Rock Content
            (2021), interactivity is important for data visualization as it is “user-driven” and makes 
            information more accessible compared to a static data visual. By designing different
            interactions for data systems, value is added to the information and the understanding 
            is heightened for users. “Emphasis” (Rock Content, 2021) in interactivity adds 
            significance to the data by highlighting important information and organizing different 
            themes. An example of this is seen on bubble charts which separate information 
            through colour, font and size of bubbles depending on the values assigned to each 
            one. 
        </p>

        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> 

        As a designer, interaction plays a crucial role in data visualization as well as design in 
        general, it allows users to understand the information being displayed. Interaction 
        within designs become easier to remember and share with other users. An example 
        of this is evident in the Triumph South Africa website (refer to table of figures). The 
        menu bar (figure 1) of the website includes bike parts, accessories and events, 
        however the it also displays a selection of bikes, which contains a surprise for the 
        user. Once a bike is chosen, the user is met with information and statistics about the 
        bike, which is visually appealing, as the user scrolls lower, an option to hear the bike 
        is provided as a “push to start” interactable button (figure 2) . The frequency of the 
        bikes engine is designed as sound waves around the button. The overall interaction 
        with the page allows the user to understand the interaction as a whole without the 
        feeling of an information overload. 
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Interaction for data visualization does not require a complex system with instructions, 
            multiple colours to attract the user or animated graphics to grab their attention. It 
            requires a relationship that allows the user and system to interact with one another by 
            means of communication. In other words, the system requires the user to express 
            what they are looking for in order for the system to display the data. The Triumph 
            website expresses this in an interesting way, once the user clicks on a bike to view, 
            the system provides the required data based on the users choice.

      <h1>Blog Post Five: Data Visualisation, Art and Representation</h1>
      <div class="date">15 November 2023</div>

      <h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Data visualization is a mechanism through which deeper analysis can be done. Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) elaborate that the “scientific visualization community” have long since looked at data visualization as a means to highlight scientific analysis.  Similarly artistic visualizations are used by artists where data is viewed as art. Art, especially techno-art as Roeser (2016) indicates, has a proclivity for articulating the abstract challenges in a more robust way. These forms of representation may be used to depict reality, for example provide character and meaning of signs or look at the denotation or connotation in text. Representation also delves deeper into the aspects of the unspoken, as Gripsrud (2006) posits that images are developed with components that are not lucidly deciphered as “word-signs of verbal language”. As a form of persuasion, representation makes a bold entry in advertising equated with “capital consumerism, globalization” and drivers of market forces or take the shape and form to create political identity. It is therefore with this frame of reference in mind that the relationships between data visualization, data art and their strategies of representation are considered and analyzed. </p>

            <p class="paragraph">Within this analysis, I will review and identify the common themes, ideas and points of interest as well as compare methodologies and results and finally create a comparative analysis that culminates in outlining the relationships between these papers and where necessary use visual representations to enhance this further still.  Arguably, the field is ever evolving and data visualization, data art and their strategies of representation would have triggered a dearth of discussion and debate that will be considered in this paper. </p>

            

      <h2>KEY THEMES AND POINTS</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        
    
        One of the key themes in the articles is the impact of technology. With the advent of new technologies, artists have a wide variety and scope to experiment with what Roeser (2016) refers to as “techno art”. In this type of art, artists experiment with “controversial aspects of new technologies” and incorporate this into their work. The writer claims that some of the predecessors of modern techno-art such as Leonardo Da Vinci have engaged with and incorporated science and technology within their art.  
      </p>
<p class="paragraph">According to Dressler and Christ (2000), techno-art may be referred to as new, creative, unconventional or progressive. In the article Roeser (2016) explains how the pre-industrial world was the catalyst for what is referred to as “utopian artistic movements” incorporating science fiction as a genre thus facilitating an imaginative era.  Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) in their article reflect on artistic visualization as it emerged from technology or rather software tools that made it possible to turn data into “artistic production”.  This brings us to another theme in the article which is the use of data. The representation of reality through semiotics identifies signs that are categorized into codes to develop understanding. According to Kidd (2015), signs and codes “construct a version of reality” in either a comprehensible or incomprehensible way.   </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        
        
        
        Artistic data visualization is data driven. Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) comments on John Salavon's work where the artist uses the images of homes in a given location and focuses on the mean averaging colour of each photo by pixel which is in fact a data point.  This is compared to computer scientists who use a similar technique in the “field of image processing”. In Golan Levin's “Power of Numbers” for example the artist develops a central display of collective data. In the “last clock” the artists use of surveillance technology and the data creates a visualization of time and location. According to Roeser (2016), techno-art can make a significant contribution in the field of artificial intelligence and information technology.  Techno-artists for example can surpass the limitations labs and developers by exploring how technology can be used to make their work more accessible to a wider audience.  Although technology brings a few challenges for example privacy concerns and the likelihood that increased automation may make society dysfunctional, societal, ethical and moral implications must be considered.
      </p>

      <h2>METHODOLOGIES AND RESULTS</h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        In the article “Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics”, Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) provide a narrative of visualizations as an analytical tool and argue that the field of contemporary technology makes it possible for data to be visualized differently. They provide a series of artworks stemming from data that has been repurposed. In this article, data is represented to construct meaning.  The use of the examples to outline the data through the averaging technique, and according to Ferdinand de Saussure every sign acquires merit because of its uniqueness. In comparison, Roeser (2016), focuses on the ethical aspects in the use of technology to create art and thus allows for assumptions to be challenged on risk prone technologies.  By doing this, it helps to create a morally sound springboard to encourage debate on issues such as climate change, stem cell research and politics. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> The methodologies used in the articles reflect a diverse view on the visualization of data.  Where one article posits a view that data can be visualized by condensing it to a degree of incomprehensibility, the information is still able to provide a sense of understanding and interaction at another level. Another article is able to use the data to understand the techno-culture and invoke critical thinking.  The contribution of knowledge in data visualization and the use of technology is not limited to these areas alone. The impact of artistic data visualization thus impacts a broader field.</p>

        <h2>CONTEXT AND IMPACT TO THE BROADER FIELD
        </h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        Li (2018) uses another dimension to explore the field of visualization through an aesthetic approach and claims that this dimension enhances the experience by “amplifying the ability to obtain knowledge”. Critical to this approach is the understanding of complex data to invoke an emotional experience.  In the field of behaviour for example, intuitive attraction is important.  Cawthon and Moere (2007) conducted an online survey to test the aesthetic effectiveness of data visualization by visualization techniques (figure 2).  The medical field for example utilized “Chinese Taoist principles to explore Chinese yijing aesthetics and Taoist body philosophy” in the technological space (figure 1) (Li, 2008).
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph"> 
            Roeser (2016), argued that contemporary techno-art is an area that is being constantly engaged with.  New literary genres are engaging new technologies in areas for example cloning, ICT and robotics.  Fields of nuclear art, bio-art and robotics-art are mentioned and even body experimentation.  Although the writer claims some of these were done in an “imaginative, playful and provocative way, these type of experimentation opens the doors for legal and ethical boundaries to be examined.  All these areas speak to the theories of representation where these fields may spark debate and may be contentious. Arguably, these topics may shift from being myths to reality and then represent the visual culture.  Advertising a mode of representation as persuasion, may look at contentious issues as the new identity.  The impact therefore in these fields are not arbitrary but follow a certain pattern that is consistent with the theories of representation.  The writers of these articles therefore provide the context of art and technology from the paradigm of data visualization. They articulate a similar narrative that the impact of especially techno-art is far reaching.  The writers support one another in that they highlight the effects of art on technology in line with positive aspects but also highlight the fact that this does not exist without certain pitfalls.  Viégas and Wattenberg (2007) for example share that the power of art is not without “sins of visual analytics”.  Data may be manipulated to produce a variety of creative art, however in so doing they may be subject to bias, distortions and inaccuracies.
            </p>
      
        <h2>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
        </h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        Overall the papers advance data visualization beyond basic visual analytics.  Though visual analytics is critical in understanding scientific analytical tasks, it clearly provides areas that need more study.  The escalation of data visualization to techno-art thus opens the scope for disruptive technology and poses certain risks when these are to be represented.  The papers reinforce the idea that data visualization is evolving, and that this evolution brings about areas that need to considered.  The articles do not reject the ideas presented but seem to build upon each other and no contradiction of theories or information was evident.  
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph"> The papers are similar in the sense that they articulate the extent of data visualization beyond the scope of visual analytics into the realm of techno-art.  The writers do in fact indicate that there are controversies surrounding the technological developments and their impact on society.  This is further amplified by the theories of representation since art is a representation of codes and conventions. With the frame of representation however, it is impacted by environmental, social, political, and cultural factors.  Art in general is unspoken and abstract which leaves much to imagination.  </p>

        <h2>CONCLUSION 

        </h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        Techno-art is a critical resource that can have positive and negative consequences.  It has the potential of highlighting fundamental societal challenges and moral reflection.  Although embedded in the art is the artists intention, a lot is left to the audience to derive understanding and interpret the signs.  The power of visualization is a significant tool of persuasion which can make a constructive contribution in understanding many challenges.  It can encourages debate and challenges assumptions.

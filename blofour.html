      <h1>Blog Post Four: A Critical Reflection of Data Driven Artwork</h1>
      <div class="date">28 October 2023</div>

      <h2>INTRODUCTION TO DATA DRIVEN ART</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            GCF Global (n.d) offers the definition of art in a poetic way that summarizes what data 
            driven art is capable of, by stating that “art is for anyone who wants to experience it”. 
            The term “experience”, can also be defined as interactivity or feeling, which is the 
            relationship created between user and the system, that being the data (University XP, 
            n.d)</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Data visualization creates that relationship in an eccentric way of displaying data. It is 
                an imaginative way of expressing and viewing data in a way that leaves the viewer 
                intrigued. In other words, “it is functional art” (Cairo, 2013). Data driven art takes data 
                visualization a step further by using a “pictorial or graphical format” that enables the 
                viewer to “identify interesting patterns, infer correlations and casualties , and supports 
                sense-making activities” (Li, 2020). Dimara and Perin (2020) elaborate how important 
                interactivity is for data visualization as it creates a sense of freedom of exploration and 
                control for the end user in a visual form. </p>

            <p class="paragraph">The information, also known as data, is translated into a “visual form” (Li, 2020) that 
                represents concepts which provide the user with a “clear understanding of forward-looking expectations” (Knaflic, 2015). Figure 1, shows an example of this from a book 
                called “Data Sketches: a journey of imagination, exploration, and beautiful data 
                visualizations” by Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu (2021) and their official website 
                VisualCinnamon.com (2023). The artwork labelled “The Essence of Us” (2022) is 
                based off all 5000+ exoplanets that were discovered since 1992. According to 
                VisualCinnamon.com (2023), Earth was placed as the centre point of the art piece, 
                while the spirals around Earth represents an exoplanet. The moving artwork leaves 
                viewers to question their existence, “what defines human culture as a whole” and how 
                other civilizations view Earth VisualCinnamon.com (2023). The overall design is 
                futuristic, which is what space exploration is about. The vibrant colours and spiral 
                movements mimic how the exoplanets orbit Earth. 
                </p>
      

      <h2>THE ROUGH IDEA</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        
    
        For my selected data driven art work, I intend to use the NASA API involving SSD 
        (Solar System Dynamics)/ CNEOS (Centre for Near-Earth Object Studies) called CAD. 
        The CAD API contains data that notifies the end user on meteoroids and comets that 
        are or have already approached the planets in our solar system (NASA, n.d). 
      </p>
<p class="paragraph">In order to design the data driven artwork with this API, I will need to separate the data 
    into four sections as seen in figure two, namely the date, the distance, the planet and 
    meteorite or comet section. The date section will consist of dates from past, present 
    and future meteorites or comet interactions. The distance section will display the 
    distance of the meteorite/comet. The planet section will show which planet the 
    meteorite/ comet is or was heading towards and the last section will determine whether 
    a meteorite or comet was or will be orbiting the mentioned planets. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        
        
        
        The data will take form in one of two ways, in a scatter plot or a bubble graph as seen 
        in figure three and figure four. I drew inspiration from Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu's 
        design from “The Royal Constellations” project in 2016 (refer to figure five). The main 
        element that grabbed my attention in this design is the theme of a constellation. The 
        overall design creates an illusion of space exploration. The design manipulates the 
        use of white space to achieve the space-like effect. As Knaflic (2015) labels provide
        the end user “a clear understanding of forward-looking expectations”, it is evident in 
        figure 5, that the use of labels clarify information for the end user so that the artwork 
        is functional instead of simply visually appealing. 
      </p>

      <h2>DATA DRIVEN ART: REASONING</h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        My two options are based off the look and feel of space, that being the patterns formed 
by the constellations as well as the movement of planets orbiting the sun. Another 
factor that contributed to the look and feel is that the theme of my website is 
surrounded by the theme of space, mostly meteorites. The overall design should 
create any emotion, as emotion cannot be controlled. The most important aspect is to 
receive a reaction that is spontaneous, since space is about the unknown, some 
people don't appreciate “not knowing” whilst others are excited by it.
        </p>

        <h2>STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE DESIGN
        </h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        There are strengths and weaknesses in this design style. The weaknesses include the 
colour choice, text and availability of white space. A darker colour palette will suit the 
overall website and theme of the data being displayed. The text requires a better 
placement as it collides with the data's art and does not leave enough room for white 
space. When represented an element involving space or exploration, white space 
plays a crucial role in the look and feel of the overall design. It makes the design 
breathable and allows the end user to view the artwork without feeling claustrophobic. 
The strengths in the data driven artwork reside in the interactivity, the zoom in and 
zoom out feature that encourages end users to explore and discover the information. 
The names/headings are not seen immediately, it is noticeable once the end user 
interacts with specific parts of the design, it is simple to use with minimal “clicking” so 
that the user isn't lost or overwhelmed. There is much to improve, however as a base 
idea and artwork, I feel that is works well to achieve the feeling of space exploration. 
        </p>
      
        <h2>CONCLUSION (IMPORTANCE AND GOALS TO ACHIEVE THROUGH DESIGN)

        </h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        Barabasi (2022) explains why the world needs more data driven art, also known as 
“dataism”. Dataism is an “artistic practice” that creates better understanding of nature, 
social developments, technologies and new discoveries. 
Data driven art opens doors and creates learning opportunities while still being visually 
appealing. As the world evolves, the amount of data increases and can sometimes be 
overwhelming for a user, and as a result difficult to understand. As designers, we are 
responsible for creating user friendly systems and designs that can communicate 
information visually. There are two main downfalls to creating data driven art, however 
they come with solutions as well. The first issue is how time consuming an artwork can 
be and the second is in some instances, the artwork lacks communication. A solution 
that may solve these issues is research. It is a designers responsibility to perform in 
depth research on the topic as well as interview the target audience to get an insight 
of their expectations. This will save time and allow the designer to make considerate 
decisions instead of focusing on the visual aspect only.
Data driven art is the next level to infographics, and it essential for designers to adapt 
to as the world is becoming more digital than ever

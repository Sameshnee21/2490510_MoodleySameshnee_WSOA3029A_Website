      <h1>Blog Post One: An Overview of Data Visualization</h1>
      <div class="date">31 June 2023</div>

      <h2>What is Data Visualization?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        
Data Visualization is the recording of information accentuated through an easier and
quicker form, of visual representation. Visual representation is an important
component used to understand and emphasize the data depicted. According to Li
(2020), data visualization dates to the 2 nd century AD and were used primarily to
“investigate the world and also to record the historical events”. The visual
representations of data became more accurate, affordable, and convenient after the
invention of computer technology. Using computer software, data is expressed
visually in charts, graphs, maps and other graphical illustrations for ease of analysis.
Li (2020) elaborates that data visualization can be understood in multiple ways,
however, the main idea that is projected, is the “connection between data and
computer technology”. In more simpler terms, data visualization creates a narrative
for “data professionals” (Coursera, 2023) in such a way that the information is
visually striking.

Li (2020) refers to Bikakis's (2018) definition of data visualization to elaborate how
visual representation is used to depict data. Bikakis (2018) stated that “data
visualization is a presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format”, which
creates a “interactive” and interesting approach to data. In graphical form, data is
expressed to understand complex patterns, trends and provide greater insight into
information.

      <h2>Why is data visualization important?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        
        The importance of data visualization is that it arranges a creative space that caters
        for audiences based on “user comprehension and customization capabilities” (Li:
        2020).
        Through the use of data visualization, both “information visualization and scientific
        information” can be represented and understood in a “visual form” (Li, 2020) .
        According to Coursera (2023), data visualization caters for almost any field of study,
        such as sports, financial fields of study, science, and many others. As a result of its
        inter-disciplinary importance, it can be used across fields where creativity is the
        cornerstone, such as in graphic design, user experience design in web design.
        
        Designers can employ data visualization in understanding user behaviour for
        example to understand interactions of users on different products and gain valuable
        insights into their decision-making processes. It could also enable designers about
        their target audiences so it could assist by converting and analyzing data that meet
        user expectations, by presenting visually appealing designs to clients related to
        market analysis, financial performance it can increase the credibility and persuade
        clients in decision-making or it can aid in enhancing communication. There are four
        main benefits highlighted by Coursera (2023), that being storytelling, accessibility,
        visualize relationships and explorations. Colors, shapes and patterns assist in
        storytelling by making information appealing and relative to audiences. Accessibility
        allows for information to be easily understood by a wide range of audiences. By
        visualizing the relationships of the information, audiences can effortlessly identify
        differences or similarities. This can be achieved if data information is compared
        withing a graph or map. Lastly, data visualization encourages exploration, for both
        designers and audiences. It brings about a creative approach to information and
        supports interaction and collaboration.
        
        There are a few common techniques to represent data information (Musa et al.,
        2016), that being “line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots” etc. These can be seen as a
        foundation of how data is presented, in other words, which techniques would be
        most suitable in terms of readability and interactivity based on the audience. A
        younger audience would have a difficult time understanding a scatter plot whilst an
        older audience would relate easily to it.
      </p>

      <h2>How does it relate to digital designers (opinion, include why representation is
        important)?</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        
        As digital designers, data visualization is important as it encourages designers to
        approach data, infographics and interactivity in different ways based on the target
        audiences. Data visualization is a broad topic to explore and experiment with, the
        main goal is to create better understanding through design. Although data
        visualization is “difficult and time consuming” (Musa et al., 2016), it drives designers
        to push their creative limits. In essence designers often craft their narrative around
        effective storytelling and aim to communicate through their work. Data visualizations
        can be integrated into storytelling narratives to present data in a fundamentally
        
        unique way by incorporating data visualization into their design processes, designers
        can achieve a new level of interaction into their designs to create greater impact.
        Data representation differs from field to field in terms of approach and information,
        with that, designers have to research and adapt to the different fields of study to
        create a visual representation most relatable.
        
        Data visualization therefore empowers designers with key insights so that they are
        able to take clear decisions that enhances their ability to communicate across
        boundaries that are otherwise affected by culture, gender, beliefs and a permutation
        of various factors that impact the design process. Through data visualization,
        designers can enable a more iterative process to refine their designs on real time
        data and feedback. Results can be visualized which will assist designers to identify
        which design variations would perform better under each circumstance. Data
        visualization therefore provides a more balanced view on interactive proto-typing so
        that designers are able to effectively simulate data into protypes so that designers
        can be tested before completion. When working with data analysts, designers can
        use data visualization to understand complex data sets and incorporate this in their
        designs.
        
        In summary, data visualization is data in real form which designers use create the
        virtual reality for a more client-centric approach. By leveraging data visualizations,
        designers are able to bring the design to life and therefore create designs that are
        more enhanced and appeal to the user.

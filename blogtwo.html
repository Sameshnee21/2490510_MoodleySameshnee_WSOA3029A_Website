      <h1>Blog Post Two: An Overview of Data Visualization</h1>
      <div class="date">28 August 2023</div>

      <h2>INTRODUCTION: HOW TO MAKE A WEBSITE INTERESTING</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
Websites are designed with the intentions of being a story. The layout, information
shared, and overall aesthetics need to contain “meaning” (Tversky, 2018) in order for
the story to be comprehended. Storytelling can be “interpreted and reinterpreted”
(Tversky, 2018) however, it is a designer's duty to tell that story in a way that allows
the user to easily navigate and interact with the system. When a user interacts with a
website, the first thing that catches their eye is the look and feel of imagery, a
comfortable colour palette and readable text. Using words and graphics, a narrative
structure is created, which forms a “beginning, middle and end”, the beginning
operates as an “entry way or introduction” (Tversky, 2018) to the website. This gives
the user an overview of what to expect, it produces expectations and highlights what
follows next. The ending creates a cliff-hanger like effect that leaves users with “much
to ponder” (Tversky, 2018).
When it comes to the information and data, designers need to consider how to make
it appealing and easy to understand, that too with careful consideration for the minority
e.g. colourblind users. According to Tversky (2018) data needs to be designed in
precise way and encourage “exploration and thought” in terms of display, “descriptions
and explanations”.
According to Jeff Cardello from WebFlow Blog (2023) explains that keeping a design
simple creates order and allows for users to interact with the system with a tutorial or
direction on where to click next. Another tip that has been highlighted is to understand
how UI/ UX benefits the user as well as the website. Cardello (2023) defines UX as a
way of “getting into the users head”, this means that by researching the target
audience, the systems usability can improve the user's experience. Cardello (2023)
summarizes how effective UI can be accomplished in 3 points, that is “functionality,
uniformity and design choices”. Functionality are the elements that help the user
explore the website, uniformity are the actions that follow the user's decision and lastly,
design choices, are the overall aesthetics of the website.
There is much to consider when designing a website, designers must carefully plan
their websites, and constantly iterate in order to improve the user experience.</p>

      
      

      <h2>WEBSITE ANALYSIS: SPACE TRAVEL</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        
    
        For my website prototype, I chose to use “exploration” literally and design a website 
        that has the look and feel of exploring space (refer to figure 1 and 2). The overall 
        design contains a plain colour palette and detailed backgrounds. I chose navy blue 
        and purple as background colours and white text so that information is legible and 
        easy to find. Figure 2 serves as references to space themed websites and the layouts 
        that avoid “clutter” (Knaflic, 2015) yet still have an aesthetic to it.
      </p>
<p class="paragraph">Each page contains a space exploration quote from famous astronauts that are easy 
    to understand and grasp as a common user. The home page or rather the 
    “introduction” that Tversky (2018) mentions contains a view of the earth with a quote, 
    this was intended to create the “wow factor” that encourages the user to interact with 
    the system. The menu bar contains simple, bold text with a plain background to make 
    the important information “as prominent as possible” (Knaflic, 2015). The information 
    being communicated is straightforward and accessible to navigate around. </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        
        
        
        In the blog post section (figure 4), a “card-flip” element was put into place to make the 
UI more interesting and unique. I wanted to avoid a monotonous experience for the 
user by adding different UI elements for each page of the website, for example, the 
design section has an image carousel to display the progress and planning, the blog 
has a back to top button and a back button etc. Although each page contains different 
UI elements, there is still “uniformity” (Cardello, 2023) that keeps the UX stimulating 
and easy to work with. Each blog post was placed on a card, once clicked, the card 
flips and reveals the heading of the blog post. The purple background of the card 
design is carried through to the post to give a space travel effect through the use of 
colour. 
The “preattentive attributes” (Knaflic, 2015) that are most visually striking in the 
website are the photographic backgrounds (refer to figure 3 and 6) that are found on 
each page, the blog post and the design section (refer to figure 4 and 5). The blog post 
and design section contain a solid purple that helps direct the user's eye towards 
important information, it also creates a “visual hierarchy” (Knaflic, 2015). Since the 
4
backgrounds are already a striking feature, the user needs another element to guide 
them. 
      </p>

      <h2>CONCLUSION (CHANGES)</h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> 
        After critically reflecting on the theory and connecting it with the first website prototype, 
the overall design needs more scrutiny as there are a few changes that are essential 
for the improvement of the UI/ UX. The website's current state leads me to believe that 
users may feel overwhelmed with the use of detailed background imagery (refer to 
figure 6) as well as the visibility of the quotes in certain backgrounds. Another 
necessary change is the layout of the blog cards and design sector (refer to figure 5 
and 6). The blog post card element contains an issue that may frustrate the user, that 
being that the front of the card does not communicate its content, the user is forced to 
click each one to find a post that interests them. In the design section, the image 
carousel looks out of place, a solution that may fix this, is to enlarge the carousel or 
create a Pinterest-like layout for the imagery. 
The website has potential to be more user friendly if the above-mentioned changes 
occur. User interface is the key to creating a better user experience, a design does not 
necessarily need to be complex to be user-friendly
